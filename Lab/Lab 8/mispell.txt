Soem years ago, never midn how long preciesly, having little or no money in
my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would
sail about a little and see the watery prat of the world. It is a way I
have of driving off teh spleen and regulating teh circulatino. Whenever I
find myself groiwng grim about the mouth; whenever it is a dapm, drizzly
Novembre in my suol; whenevre I find msyelf involuntarily pausing bfeore
coffni wareohuses, adn bringing up teh rear of every funeral I meet; and
espceially wheenver my hpyos gte such an upper hand of me, that it rqeuires
a strong moral principle to prevent me frmo deliberately stepping into the
street, and methodically knocking peoples' hats off- thne, I accoutn it
high tmie to get to sea as soon as I can. Tihs is my substitute for psitol
and ball. With a philosophical flourish Caot throws himself upon his swodr;
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in tihs. If they
but knew it, almost all men in theri dergee, some tiem or ohter, cehrish
veyr nearyl the saem feelnigs toawrds the ocean with me.
